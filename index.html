		<h1>Hate page on JerryBot Prime</h1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>Jerrybot Prime has not been performing to the expected standards and has not been meeting the goals set by the team. As a result, it is necessary to demote Jerrybot Prime in order to ensure that the team is able to continue to meet its objectives.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>Jerrybot Prime is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to automate tasks and make decisions. While this technology has the potential to be incredibly useful, it also raises a number of ethical and safety concerns. Jerrybot Prime could be used to make decisions that could harm people or their property, or it could be used to manipulate people into making decisions that are not in their best interest. Additionally, AI technology is still relatively new and untested, so it is difficult to predict the long-term consequences of using Jerrybot Prime. For these reasons, it is important to proceed with caution when considering the use of Jerrybot Prime and to ensure that all safety protocols are in place.<p>
